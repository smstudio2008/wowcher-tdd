# Task:

Review, refactor and complete the code task. This is a simple JS project created with Node and Express.  The task is to complete the missing functionality and look for problems, bugs and improvements that can be made to increase the standard/quality of the project.  There are 3 functions that have not been completed:

1. getOrderCountForProduct - This should return the number of times a product has been ordered given the product name

2. getCustomerNamesForProduct - This should return the names of customers that have ordered a product in an array, with no duplication 

3. getMostPopularProduct - This should return an array containing the most popular product(s)

4. Create a graphical User Interface to represent the data, using navigation and data tables, leveraging the API's above.

*Task 4 has not been set up, feel free to use any framework you like, or just a simple HTML, SASS layout. The choice is yours.*
